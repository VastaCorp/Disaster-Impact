# Disaster-Impact
The program will be built to deal with most of the natural calamities such as earthquakes, tsunami, floods, hurricanes and many more. The basic idea behind tackling with them is given below for each calamity.

EARTHQUAKES: By obtaining the seismographic data by various seimograph across a state, the program will triangulate the epicentre. As seismic waves get reflected by the crust their reflection keeps changing. The program will also be able to analyze the waves and calculate the probable epicentres taking into account the changing direction of seismic waves.

HURRICANE: The program will be able to analyse information from data buoys placed throughout the Gulf of Mexico and along the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards which relay by radio signals and/or via satellite information including air and water temperature, wind speed, air pressure and wave conditions; and calculate the location where the hurricane or cyclone is developing. The program will also render predicted areas prone to damage.

FLOODS: Based on data from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Global Precipitation Measurement(GPM), the program will flag areas as flood and further process the flood signal data to generate time series, flood maps and flood animations.
